# All Signer Function Working with MoveVM Wallet
Commonly used in blockchain applications to prove ownership of a wallet address by single signing messages

## 1️⃣ Sign Message
```typescript
const onSignMessage = async () => {
  const payload = {
    message: "Hello from Aptos Wallet Adapter",
    nonce: Math.random().toString(16),
  };
  const response = await signMessage(payload);
  toast({
    title: "Success",
    description: JSON.stringify({ onSignMessage: response }),
  });
};
```
This is the simpler version of message signing that:
- Creates a basic message + nonce
- Signs it with your wallet
- Perfect for basic authentication needs

## 2️⃣ Sign and Verify Messages

```typescript
const onSignMessageAndVerify = async () => {
  const payload = {
    message: "Hello from Aptos Wallet Adapter",
    nonce: Math.random().toString(16),
  };
  const response = await signMessageAndVerify(payload);
  toast({
    title: "Success",
    description: JSON.stringify({ onSignMessageAndVerify: response }),
  });
};
```

What's happening here?
- We're creating a simple message with a random nonce (like a unique ID)
- Getting it signed by the wallet
- Making sure the signature is legit

💡 **tip**: Adding that random nonce is super important - it prevents anyone from reusing old signatures


## 3️⃣ Sign Transaction (Legacy)
- This is the legacy way to sign transactions. Still works but has some limitations.
```typescript
const onSignTransaction = async () => {
  try {
    const payload = {
      type: "entry_function_payload",
      function: "0x1::coin::transfer",
      type_arguments: ["0x1::aptos_coin::AptosCoin"],
      arguments: [account?.address, 1], // 1 is in Octas
    };
    const response = await signTransaction(payload);
    toast({
      title: "Success",
      description: JSON.stringify(response),
    });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
  }
};
```

## 4️⃣ Sign Transaction V2

```typescript
const onSignTransactionV2 = async () => {
  if (!account) return;
  try {
    const transactionToSign = await aptosClient(network).transaction.build.simple({
      sender: account.address,
      data: {
        function: "0x1::coin::transfer",
        typeArguments: [APTOS_COIN],
        functionArguments: [account.address, 1], // 1 Octa
      },
    });
    const response = await signTransaction(transactionToSign);
    toast({
      title: "Success",
      description: JSON.stringify(response),
    });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
  }
};
```

This one's pretty straightforward:
- Creates a simple token transfer transaction
- Gets it signed by your wallet
- Shows a success message when everything's good


## 5️⃣ Sign and Submit BCS Transaction

```typescript
const onSignAndSubmitBCSTransaction = async () => {
  if (!account) return;

  try {
    const response = await signAndSubmitTransaction({
      data: {
        function: "0x1::coin::transfer",
        typeArguments: [parseTypeTag(APTOS_COIN)],
        functionArguments: [AccountAddress.from(account.address), new U64(1)],
      },
    });
    await aptosClient(network).waitForTransaction({
      transactionHash: response.hash,
    });
    toast({
      title: "Success",
      description: <TransactionHash hash={response.hash} network={network} />,
    });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
  }
};
```

This is the cool one! It:
- Signs AND submits your transaction in one go
- Uses BCS (fancy way of encoding data that's more efficient)
- Waits for confirmation
- Shows you a clickable transaction hash

💡 **What makes this one special?**
- It's a one-stop-shop: signs and submits in one function
- Uses BCS format (smaller size = lower fees)
- Makes sure your transaction is confirmed before saying "success"
- Gives you a link to check your transaction on the explorer
